## Project Overview

HeadlinesAI is an intelligent news recommendation system that learns from user interactions to provide personalized content. Built as a demonstration of AI capabilities on Cloudflare's platform, this project showcases modern serverless architecture with AI integration.

### Development Notice
This is a **development project** created quickly to demonstrate understanding of AI workflows and Cloudflare infrastructure. The current dataset only includes **Europe and North America** regions and covers **politics and sports** categories. For production use, the system would benefit from:
- Fine-tuning the LLM models
- Enhanced dataset integration
- More sophisticated user profiling
- Advanced filtering algorithms

Results may vary as this uses a basic dataset, but the architecture can be easily fine-tuned for production scenarios.

## Architecture & Components

### AI Integration
- **LLM**: Utilizes **Llama 3.3 on Cloudflare Workers AI** for intelligent content analysis and recommendations
- **Natural Language Processing**: Processes user queries and extracts intent and preferences
- **Content Summarization**: AI-powered news summarization and tagging

### Cloudflare Infrastructure
- **Workers**: Serverless functions handling API requests and business logic
- **Workflows**: Orchestrates complex AI processing pipelines
- **Pages**: Frontend hosting for the React-based user interface
- **KV Storage**: Fast, global key-value storage for session data

### User Interface
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat-based news discovery
- **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant responses through Cloudflare Pages

### Memory & Personalization
- **Cross-Origin Session Management**: Custom header-based session persistence with localStorage fallback
- **Intelligent User Profiling**: Automatic topic and region preference extraction from conversations
- **Reading History Tracking**: Prevents duplicate article recommendations across sessions
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns from user queries to improve future recommendations

## How It Works

### News Ranking System
The system uses two key factors for ranking news recommendations:

1. **Location and Topic Based**: Prioritizes content matching user's geographic and subject preferences
2. **Novelty Factor**: Shows previously unseen content to avoid repetition

### Learning from User Behavior
Example workflow demonstrating intelligent learning:

1. **First Query**: "Give me news about Donald Trump"
   - **AI Analysis**: Extracts topics: ["politics"], region: "North America"
   - **System Learning**: Stores preferences in KV storage linked to user session
   - **Result**: Shows 5 politics articles from North America (IDs: 17-21)

2. **Second Query**: "Suggest some news"  
   - **Preference Retrieval**: Loads stored preferences: politics + North America
   - **Smart Filtering**: Prioritizes unseen articles matching learned preferences
   - **Novelty Factor**: Excludes previously shown articles (17-21)
   - **Result**: Shows different relevant articles (IDs: 1-5) based on preferences

3. **Continuous Learning**: Each interaction refines the user profile for better recommendations

### Workflow Pipeline
```
User Input → Session Check → AI Analysis → Preference Merge → Content Filter → History Update → AI Summarization
     ↓             ↓            ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓              ↓
  Chat UI  →  KV Storage  →  Workers AI  →  KV Storage  →  Workflows  →  KV Storage  →  React UI
```

**8-Step Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Session Management**: Retrieve or create user session with X-Session-ID header
2. **Preference Loading**: Get stored user preferences from KV storage  
3. **AI Tagging**: Llama 3.3 extracts topics and regions from current query
4. **Preference Merging**: Combine historical and current preferences intelligently
5. **Article Filtering**: Filter 32 articles by preferences and exclude seen articles
6. **History Tracking**: Update user's seen articles list in KV storage
7. **AI Summarization**: Generate personalized summaries for selected articles
8. **Response Delivery**: Return ranked, summarized articles to React UI
